    <h2>Why Should You Choose MySQL?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>MySQL is globally renowned for being the most secure and reliable database management system used in popular web applications like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Facebook and Twitter. The data security and support for transactional processing that accompany the recent version of MySQL, can greatly benefit any business especially if it is an eCommerce business that involves frequent money transfers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>MySQL offers unmatched scalability to facilitate the management of deeply embedded apps using a smaller footprint even in massive warehouses that stack terabytes of data. On-demand flexibility is the star feature of MySQL. This open source solution allows complete customization to eCommerce businesses with unique database server requirements.</p>
    <p>MySQL features a distinct storage-engine framework that facilitates system administrators to configure the MySQL database server for a flawless performance. Whether it is an eCommerce website that receives a million queries every single day or a high-speed transactional processing system, MySQL is designed to meet even the most demanding applications while ensuring optimum speed, full-text indexes and unique memory caches for enhanced performance.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why Should You Choose Mircosoft SQL?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>It can be installed via a setup wizard and the prerequisite updates are detected and downloaded by the installer automatically. The complexity of installing the software is minimized significantly because of automatic installation of updates. Other components such as analytical and database services can be installed separately afterward. Automatic updation also reduces maintenance costs quite significantly.</p>
    <br>
    <p>SQL Server 2008 uses Policy-Based Management to detect security policies that are non-compliant. This feature allows only authorized personnel access to the database. Security audits and events can be written automatically to log files.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The MS SQL server has built-in transparent data compression feature along with encryption. Users donâ€™t need to modify programs in order to encrypt the data. The MS SQL server has access control coupled with efficient permission management tools. Further, it offers an enhanced performance when it comes to data collection.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why Should You Choose Oracle?</h2>
    <p>Oracle is ported to more platforms than any of its competition, running on more than 100 hardware platforms and 20 networking protocols. This makes writing an Oracle application fairly safe from changes of direction in hardware and operating system, and therefore a safe bet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Oracle is by far the largest RDBMS Vendor, and spends more on R&amp;D than most of its competitors earn in total revenue.  Oracle has the largest independent RDBMS market share in VMS, UNIX and OS/2 Server fields.  This market clout means that you are unlikely to be left in the lurch by Oracle and there are always lots of third party interfaces supported and also, proficient staff are relatively easy to get.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Oracle seem very good at informing you in detail as to what is not going to be supported in the next major release and usually have some knob you can twiddle for good backward compatibility, or simply leave it working, but with "don't use this, use xxxx instead" warnings in the manual.  Backward compatibility is very good meaning you will not be in for an application re-write when you upgrade the DBMS.  [Compare this with the Ingres v5-&#62;6 OSQL upgrade from hell.]</p>
